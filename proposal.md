| **Data**       | What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API. | I will use the Makeup API (http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/) to gather product data including product names, brands, types, tags, and prices. User data will be collected upon registration, and preferences for makeup products will be stored in the user profile for the "Picks for You" feature. Additionally, user preferences will help filter recommendations based on their choices, such as foundation shade or favorite brands. |
